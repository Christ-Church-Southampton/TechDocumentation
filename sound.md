# Sound guide

### AM: Cantell

#### Setup

1. Arrival time is 8:30 am when there are two gatherings. Outside of uni term times when there is only a 10:30 gathering you can arrive at 9:30.
2. Help unload the car
3. Work with the band to get everything setup
  - Check that the stage blocks are in sensible positions before starting
  - Depending on their experience it may be helpful for you do to slightly less and direct them a little more, or you may be free to get on with it and trust them to take care of their side of things.
  - The speaker stands live in Cantell's cupboard, you may have to ask for it to be unlocked before you can get to them. Everything else you need should arrive in the car.

  > It is worth booting the tablet near the start of the process and checking if it needs to charge a bit while the rest of setup is happening.
  > This also prevents the soundcheck being delayed if it takes a while to turn on later
