# CCS Visuals Guide

### AM: Cantell

1. Arrive @ 8:30 am.
2. Collect visuals laptop bag (grey fabric laptop bag) from the pile at the front/car.
3. Set up the laptop on the balcony (the laptop battery isn’t great so make sure you plug the charger in somewhere).
   If the balcony is locked ask the site manager or at reception to get it unlocked. 
   > we don’t use the schools computers but you may be told to use a particular one by whoever unlocks it, just politely ignore them. 
4. Unplug the VGA cable from the back of the computer on the left and plug it into the VGA to HDMI adapter that should be in the laptop bag, then plug this    into the laptop (see pictures below).

6. Turn on projector with the small white remote that is usually on the shelves on the 
balcony, if its not, ask for it at reception (the remote works from the balcony and it should auto detect the source) 
6. Open EasyWorship on the laptop and open the schedule for the service you are at.
7. Using the projector remote, make sure the projector is set to project in 16:9. In EasyWorship go to Edit>Options and set the Width as 1080, height as 720 and Left as 1480. This should line up the picture on the screen. 
8. Check with the worship leader that the songs are in the correct order and that you have the same arrangement of verses and choruses that they are going to sing. 
9. If there are not sermon slides already in the schedule, be on the look out for the preacher and ask if they have any slides. When adding their slides to the schedule its best to convert them to images before importing them to EasyWorship so that the program can automatically scale them to fit on the projector screen.
10. Run the service as normal (remember Orlando put his sermon notes online at https://christchurchsouthampton.org.uk/sermon so you know when to change slide). 
11. After the 9:30 service, make any changes to songs/order that you noticed were required so its all good to go for the 11:15. 
12. After the 11:15 turn the projector off, shut the laptop down, unplug everything from the laptop and put it in the laptop bag (Remember to put the VGA-HDMI converter in the laptop bag) and plug the schools VGA cable back into the back of the computer on the left. 
13. Return the laptop to the front and the projector remote to wherever you found it. 

If there is a video, fetch the AUX to XLR cable from the top of Betha (the big wheely case of sound equipment), plug the AUX end into the laptop and the XLR ends into numbers 3 and 4 on cantells stage box under the desk the laptop is on (see picture below). The sound person should then be able to plug the other end in and assist with any problems. Once its all plugged in, test the sound with the sound person before the service starts.


### PM: BRL

1. Arrive @ 4:30 
2. Lower the screen (remote on top shelf of the cupboard nearest JdM’s office) and turn on the projector (use stick stored next to where the laptop plugs in to press the on button on the projector) 
3. Set up laptop on the desk with the library computer on it next to the central pillar. Plug into the HDMI splitter on the back of the central pillar with a HDMI cable from the laptop bag. (The laptop battery isn’t great so make sure you plug the charger in.) 
4. Set up the camera on the tripod in front of the desk with the laptop on. (The camera needs plugging into the sound desk via the snake, the person on sound can assist with this if you are unsure.) Turn camera on and point it at the lectern where the preacher will be standing, it should autofocus. If it has low battery there is charger you can plug into the camera in the camera bag. 
5. Open EasyWorship and load the PM schedule. Go to Edit>Options and change the monitor from custom to secondary monitor, this should reset it to the default for the library. 
6. Check with the worship leader that the songs are in the correct order and that you have the same arrangement of verses and choruses that they are going to sing.
7. If there are not sermon slides already in the schedule, be on the look out for the preacher and ask if they have any slides. When adding their slides to the schedule its best to convert them to images before importing them to EasyWorship so that the program can automatically scale them to fit on the projector screen. 
8. Run the service as normal (remember Orlando puts his sermon notes online at https://christchurchsouthampton.org.uk/sermon so you know when to change slide). Make sure the camera is pointing at the lectern and press the record button before the reading starts then press the button again after the sermon has finished to stop the recording. 
9. After the service, turn everything off and unplug it and put all the bits in their relevant bags, return laptop, camera and tripod to JdM’s office. They go in the big box on the shelves. Also raise the screen. 
If there is a video, get the AUX to XLR cable from the sound box and plug the AUX end into the laptop and the XLR’s into the end of the snake/a long XLR. The sound person can assist with all this. Once its all plugged in, test the sound with the sound person before the service starts.
